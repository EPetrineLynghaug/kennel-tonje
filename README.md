## About the Project

This project demonstrates how to combine modern tools and frameworks to build a professional React application. The use of Vite ensures a fast development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and Material UI provides a responsive, pre-designed component library.

## Technologies

The project uses:
- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** – A fast bundler and development server.
- **Material UI (MUI)** – A React component library for responsive UI design.
- [**@vitejs/plugin-react**](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) (or [**@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)) for fast refresh.
- **ESLint** – To maintain code quality and consistent styling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer is recommended)
- npm (or yarn, if preferred)

### Running the Project Locally
To start the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), run:
 ```bash 
 npm run dev
 ```
 ### Building for Production
